Project Name: Twitter Clone (_had to state the original_)

Description: This "Twitter Clone" is what it says it is...a TWITTER CLONE. It does the most basic functions a social media platform can: make accounts, like and unlike tweets,
             and create or post tweets. It is a basic and simple version of X or Twitter as it doesn't have image uploading, account algorithms, nor any other advanced features.
             I was unable to provide any of the aforementioned features because of the lack of time and sleep (_literally it is 12:47 AM_), but I still managed to follow the minimal
             instructions needed for this project. Below are further details.

Features:
- Creating an account / Logging in an account
- Tweeting / Creating worded posts
- Liking and Unliking posts from other accounts
- Viewing other people's accounts
- In short: CRUD OPERATIONS
  
Database: Originally used SQLite as a database ; Now using Laravel Cloud's built in Database
